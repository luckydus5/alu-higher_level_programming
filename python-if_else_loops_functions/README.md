# Python - if/else, loops, functions

## üìò Description
This project introduces the basics of **Python control flow**, including `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, as well as `for` and `while` loops, and defining simple **functions**.  
It is part of the **ALU Higher Level Programming** curriculum.

The tasks help you practice:
- Making decisions in programs using conditionals
- Using loops to repeat actions
- Writing and calling Python functions
- Working with ASCII characters
- Using Python‚Äôs built-in functions and format strings

## üß† Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without Google):

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome  
- The difference between **indenting** in Python and other languages  
- How to use **if** and **if...else** statements  
- How to use **comments** to document code  
- How to use the **while** and **for** loops  
- How to use **break** and **continue** statements  
- What are **Boolean operators** and how to use them  
- How to define a **function** and call it  
- How to use the **return** statement in a function  
- How to use the **ord()** and **chr()** functions  
- What are **ASCII** characters and how to use them

| `3-print_alphabt.py` | Prints the lowercase alphabet except `q` and `e` |
| `4-print_hexa.py` | Prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal |
| `5-print_comb2.py` | Prints numbers from 00 to 99 separated by commas |
| `6-print_comb3.py` | Prints all possible combinations of two different digits |
| `7-islower.py` | Function that checks for lowercase characters |
| `8-uppercase.py` | Function that prints a string in uppercase |
